# Glin UI — Product Vision

## The Bet

Apple moved the entire industry toward liquid glass with visionOS, iOS 26, and macOS Tahoe. Every native app will look like this within 2 years. **There is no dominant glassmorphic component library for the web.** shadcn owns the "clean minimal" space. Magic UI owns "animated effects." Aceternity owns "dark mode showcase." Nobody owns **production-grade liquid glass for React.**

Glin UI fills that gap.

**Our moat:** Not random blur effects. A *coherent design system* built on glass physics — refraction, depth, luminance, surface tension — that ships as accessible, performant components.

## What We Are Building

### Core Product: `@glinui/ui`
Open-source React component library. Glassmorphic-first. Accessible. Performant. Two install paths:
1. **Copy-paste** (shadcn-compatible registry): `npx shadcn@latest add @glinui/glass-card`
2. **Package install**: `pnpm add @glinui/ui`

### Supporting Packages
| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@glinui/tokens` | Design tokens — OKLCH colors, glass blur/opacity, shadows, spacing, motion |
| `@glinui/motion` | Animation presets with perf budgets and reduced-motion fallbacks |
| `@glinui/registry` | Component metadata for CLI/copy-paste distribution |
| `@glinui/cli` | `npx glinui init` / `npx glinui add` — own CLI (future) |

### Documentation: `glinui.com`
Next.js docs site with live demos, copy/paste snippets, API tables, and "glass physics" design guides.

## Component Taxonomy

### Tier 1 — Primitives (Foundation)

## Design Language — "Glass Physics"

The design system is built on real optical principles, not arbitrary blur values:

### Surface Model
- **Background blur** — simulates frosted glass depth (4px, 12px, 24px levels)
- **Surface opacity** — how transparent the "glass" is (0.02 to 0.15)
- **Border luminance** — subtle edge highlight simulating light refraction
- **Shadow depth** — elevation creates parallax shadow offset

### Color System (OKLCH)
- Perceptually uniform — colors stay balanced across light/dark
- Glass-optimized — designed to look correct *through* blur layers
- Semantic tokens — background, surface, accent, border (not arbitrary hex)

### Motion Language
- **Durations**: fast (120ms), normal (220ms), slow (360ms)
- **Easing**: standard (natural decel), emphasize (slight overshoot for glass bounce)
- **Budget**: All animations must maintain 60fps on mid-tier hardware
- **Reduced motion**: Every animation has a graceful static fallback

## Distribution Strategy

### Phase A: shadcn Registry Compatibility
Register as a shadcn namespace so users can immediately `npx shadcn@latest add @glinui/glass-card`. This bootstraps adoption through the existing shadcn ecosystem.

### Phase B: Own CLI
`npx glinui init` / `npx glinui add` — full control over the install experience, theming presets, and pro component gating.

### Phase C: Package Install
`pnpm add @glinui/ui` for teams who want a traditional dependency. Tree-shakeable, typed, versioned.

## Business Model

### Free (OSS Core)
- All Tier 1 primitives
- All Tier 2 signature components
- Basic tokens and motion presets
- Documentation and examples

### Pro (Paid)
- Tier 3 blocks (pre-built sections)
- Tier 4 full page templates
- Premium theme packs (different glass styles)
- Priority support and Discord access
- Commercial license for agencies

### Revenue Targets
- **Phase 1**: Build community (0 revenue, pure OSS)
- **Phase 2**: Launch pro templates ($29-99 per template)
- **Phase 3**: Template bundles ($199-499)
- **Phase 4**: Enterprise/agency licensing

## Success Metrics

### Adoption (First 6 Months)
- 1,000+ GitHub stars
- 500+ weekly npm downloads
- 50+ components shipped
- Active Discord/community

### Revenue (Month 6-12)
- First template sales
- $1K+ MRR from pro content
- 3+ paying agency customers

### Brand (Year 1)
- "Glin UI" recognized as the glassmorphic UI option for React
- Conference talk or blog post feature
- Contributor community forming

## Technical North Star

1. **Accessibility is non-negotiable** — Every component passes WCAG 2.1 AA. Radix UI for behavior, custom glass styling on top.
2. **Performance is a feature** — Glass effects are GPU-heavy. We budget for them. Every component has a lightweight fallback mode.
3. **Developer experience wins** — TypeScript-first. Excellent prop types. Copy-paste and package install. Docs that make adoption effortless.
4. **Themeable by default** — CSS custom properties + tokens. Swap the glass intensity, color palette, or motion style without forking components.
5. **Progressive enhancement** — Works without JS for basic rendering. Animations enhance, never gate functionality.

## Competitive Intelligence — What To Watch

| Competitor | Watch For | Our Response |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| shadcn/ui | Adding glass/frost themes | Go deeper on glass physics, not just blur |
| Magic UI | Adding more production components | Focus on quality + system coherence |
| Aceternity | Open-sourcing more | Ship faster, better docs |
| Apple | New HIG glass patterns | Adopt immediately into token system |
| Tailwind | v4 changes | Stay compatible, use new features early |
| Radix | New primitives | Adopt and glass-theme them |

## The One-Line Pitch

**"Liquid Glass Components for React — the design system Apple's web never shipped."**
